You can watch the live version here: https://davidhuertabeltran.github.io/rgba-color-change/

Or if you want, you can:

1. clone the repository

2. `npm install`

3. `gulp watch` (to visualize in the browser) - in case you get an error in console try to run this code: `npm install -g gulp` and then `gulp watch` again.
